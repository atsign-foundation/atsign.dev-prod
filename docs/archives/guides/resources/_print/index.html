The platform is based on the @protocol - a network protocol for the secure exchange of information only between known entities. It uses a unique identifier called an @sign that, combined with the @platform (which is based on the @protocol), allows people the freedom to share, withhold, or retract their information at will with minimal effort, and the developer no longer has to bear the cost and risk of storing and managing people’s personal data.</p><h4 id=protocol->@protocol :</h4><p>The @protocol is the underlying network protocol used by the @platform.The @protocol&rsquo;s objective is to provide end-to-end encrypted data transfer between two known @signs, but also provides access to publicly available data that is cryptographically signed by the creating @sign.</p><h4 id=sign>@sign</h4><p>Each participant in the @protocol has a unique identifier known as an @sign. @sign’s are centrally registered and the rest of the infrastructure is fully distributed.Every @sign has a unique secondary server microservice that is accessible on the Internet via a unique Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and TCP/IP port number and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.</p><h4 id=root-server->root server :</h4><p>The root servers are the only centralized part of the @protocol and are centralized to provide a single namespace and a globally dependable platform. No data beyond the @sign and responding authoritative secondary server is held on the root servers. This information is considered public, and no authentication is required to look up the secondary server for a particular @sign.</p><h4 id=secondary-server->secondary server :</h4><p>Secondary servers provide the second tier of the @protocol architecture, and are responsible for answering lookups for specific @signs. Secondary servers are generally deployed as microservices running on orchestrators such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, but can also run as standalone executables. Secondary servers have to be uniquely Internet addressable through use of an FQDN & Port pair that can be translated via DNS to a unique IP & Port.</p><div class=slideshow-container><div class=intiser><q>I remember seeing The @ Company on a flutter event page for the first time and being immediately captivated by its concept, eventually attending all meetings and workshops despite the time difference.</q></div><div class=intiser style=display:none><q>With the @protocol's unique infrastructure, in-design privacy and off-the-rack backend, a developer has it easy with focusing on other parts of app development and ultimately reduces the overall developemnt time.</q></div><div class=intiser style=display:none><q>After all this time, I think the @platform has come a long way and it will continue to get better and better as time passes.

The rise in popularity of applications with features like end-to-end encryption is but one example. But such solutions are difficult to build, expensive to operate and often insufficient in the degree that they actually deliver privacy.</p><p>The current status quo, in which businesses collect and consolidate consumer data, results in large databases that are tempting targets for hackers. Because of this, new privacy laws such as the <a href=https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/>GDPR</a>, <a href=https://www.acc.com/resource-library/quick-overview-understanding-california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa>CCPA</a>, and 17 US <a href=https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/>state legislations</a> are being implemented. Compliance with these laws is a challenge developers face today that is often treated as an afterthought,and we believe that a better approach is to use a platform that delivers “privacy by design” and assures compliance from the outset.</p><p>Thus we have created a new architecture that addresses these issues at a fundamental level, starting with a new network protocol and a modern development platform implementation that makes it easy for developers to deliver “privacy first” applications.</p><p>If you are thinking about how to deliver applications that are end-to-end encrypted, surveillance-free, and resistant to malicious hacking, read on. The @platform is designed to make it easy to do just that.</p><h2 id=a-simple-definition-of-the-platform>A Simple Definition of the @platform</h2><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 1.png" alt="@platform definition" width=65%></td><p><br>Figure 1. A Simple Definition of the @platform</p><p>The @ Company has created an open platform for developers who want to create applications that give people full control of their digital selves. The platform is based on the @protocol - a network protocol for the secure exchange of information only between known entities. It uses a unique identifier called an @sign that, combined with the @platform (which is based on the @protocol), allows people the freedom to share, withhold, or retract their information at will with minimal effort, and the developer no longer has to bear the cost and risk of storing and managing people’s personal data.</p><h1 id=technology-overview>Technology Overview</h1><p>This document describes a software platform with the necessary technology and tools to help developers create beautiful privacy-first mobile applications that are end-to-end encrypted, surveillance-free, and resistant to malicious hacking.</p><p>It is called the @platform, and is an open source project intended to make it easy for developers to develop and deploy just such applications including the requisite supporting infrastructure at no cost.</p><p>The @platform open source project is embodied in a <a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation>public repository</a> which includes a full stack reference implementation, SDKs for application developers, useful documentation, tools, samples, and examples.</p><p>The reference implementation is licensed under the <a href=https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/>BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” License</a>. At the time of writing, a version written in the <a href=https://dart.dev/>Dart</a> language that supports the Flutter cross-platform framework has been released, with other languages and framework support expected in the future.</p><p>The technology is distributed via the <a href=https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages>Pub package manager</a> as <a href=https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages>libraries</a> for application developers, and via <a href=https://hub.docker.com/u/atsigncompany>dockerhub</a> as containers for developers' infrastructure components.</p><h1 id=from-the-perspective-of-an-application-developer>From the Perspective of an Application Developer</h1><h2 id=the-beautiful-thing-about-a-protocol>The Beautiful Thing About a Protocol</h2><p>There are many important and unique things that arise as a result of an architecture based on a protocol. There is ample precedence for this statement based on other successful examples (SMTP and TCP/IP come to mind). The most important things for an application developer to know about how to use the @platform are:</p><ul><li>Data and processing are pushed to the edge of the internet.</li><li>Applications are based on a peer-to-peer shared data model.</li><li>The sharing of access to private data between application instances is end-to-end encrypted only between provable known parties to prevent surveillance, leakage, or other hijacking attacks.</li></ul><p>These things are the result of the use of the @protocol and can seem very different from the traditional client-server or API means of sharing access to data. Thus, the mental model for such a system, especially from an application developer&rsquo;s perspective, is worthy of discussion up front.</p><h4 id=heading></h4><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 2.png" alt="Data shared on a device" width=70%></td><br>Figure 2: Example of How to Store Shared Data on a Device<p>As shown above, an application developer need only use the platform SDKS to store the application data locally on the device and include an @sign to share it with; the @platform will ensure that the data gets routed to the intended destination in a safe and secure manner. This peer-to-peer model is in contrast to centralized data stores that are fraught with risk of intentional or accidental breach or exposure of private data.</p><h2 id=a-different-way-of-thinking-about-data>A Different Way of Thinking About Data</h2><p>Certainly, there are many benefits to a decentralized data model with strict control on the part of the owner, and the @platform ensures that sharing access to private data is end-to-end encrypted, surveillance free and resistant to malicious hacking. But, there are other benefits of this architecture that may not be so obvious.</p><h3 id=people-own-their-data>People Own Their Data</h3><p>While this is obvious for a “privacy by design” platform, there are additional features that arise from adherence to this principle.</p><ul><li>Data can be portable between similar applications (i.e. swap one Calendar app for another without losing your data), which gives people more choices.</li><li>Application’s data can be shared between disparate applications (e.g. Contacts. Events, Messages) to create altogether new user experiences.</li><li>Applications can reason over “all” their data to produce compelling new services, perhaps aided by ML algorithms (with inferences executed on the mobile device in order to preserve privacy).</li></ul><h3 id=end-to-end-encryption>End-to-End Encryption</h3><p>The @platform ensures that the owner of their data has complete control over it. This is a result of three basic things (though there are many more additional options available that are explained below):</p><ol><li>Encryption happens at the edge.</li><li>The encryption keys are only available at the edge.</li><li>Data sharing is uniquely encrypted between the owner and the intended recipient.</li></ol><h3 id=data-on-the-edge>Data on The Edge</h3><p>A person’s private data is only available “in the clear” on either the owner’s device since only they have the keys to decrypt it or from cached data that can only be decrypted on the device of the recipient it was shared with. This removes the centralized target for hackers and makes any attempt at a large-scale data breach impractical.</p><h3 id=p2p-peer-to-peer-person-to-person>P2P (peer-to-peer, person-to-person)</h3><p>Also important to note is the fact that centralized, shared-tenant resources are no longer required for the sharing of access to private data. This not only saves cost, it also increases performance and security from things like denial of service attacks.</p><h3 id=a-kind-of-polymorphism>A Kind of Polymorphism</h3><p>This means of end-to-end encryption of data has a very interesting side effect in that it produces a kind of polymorphism. Since the shared data is end-to-end encrypted uniquely peer-to-peer between two parties, the answer to a query depends on who is asking, and a different response may be returned for different parties for the same query. For example:</p><table><tr><td><strong>Query</strong></td><td><strong>Who’s asking</strong></td><td><strong>Response</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3>location@alice</td><td>anonymous&lt;public></td><td>California</td></tr><tr><td>@bob</td><td>Bay Area</td></tr><tr><td>@carol</td><td>Home &lt;address></td></tr></table><p>This has already been used to create some very interesting new UX (User Experience) designs and offers many other potential use cases.</p><h4 id=heading-1></h4><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 3.png" alt="Conceptual Model" width=70%></td><br>Figure 3: Data Model Includes Owner Data and Cached Data from Others<br><p>Enforcing data ownership is another important concept as illustrated in Figure 3. In this system, application data becomes a combination of data created by one @sign combined with data that has been shared by others. Since the shared data is encrypted uniquely for the intended recipient, it can only be accessed by them. In addition, the owner maintains control of it (i.e. updates and deletes), though it may be cached for offline use. This means the owner can literally delete their information from another person&rsquo;s phone.</p><h1 id=the-platform-architecture-under-the-covers>The @platform Architecture (Under the Covers)</h1><p>For those who are interested in the nitty-gritty details, this section covers many of the architecture and design details that have been used for the development of this project.</p><h2 id=functional-goals>Functional Goals</h2><ul><li>Provably true privacy and security.</li><li>Support for all popular device architectures with native levels of performance.</li><li>Robust, resilient, and scalable to internet levels.</li></ul><h2 id=technical-goals>Technical Goals</h2><ul><li>Dependable - designed for global scale (~100 billion people, entities, or things).</li><li>Extensible - the platform is simple and extensible.</li><li>Near real time - data currency ensured.</li><li>Online/offline use is supported.</li></ul><h2 id=architectural-guidelines>Architectural Guidelines</h2><ul><li>Modular, componentized design for flexibility and extensibility.</li></ul><h2 id=design-patterns-and-methodologies>Design Patterns And Methodologies</h2><h3 id=separation-of-concerns>Separation of Concerns</h3><p>Great care has been taken when designing this architecture to apply the principles of “Separation of Concerns”.

The SDKs are designed to take care of this complexity for the developer with the goal of making such security ubiquitous.</p><h1 id=the-atclientsdk-at_client_sdkhttpsgithubcomatsign-foundationat_client_sdk>The AtClientSDK (<a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_client_sdk>at_client_sdk</a>)</h1><p>The AtClientSDK encapsulates the @protocol verbs and provides an application level abstraction that is familiar to developers.</p><h2 id=setup-and-configuration-methods>Setup and Configuration Methods</h2><p>The AtClientSDK requires initialization and setup. For convenience, there is a preference object with default settings that is used to configure the instance.</p><h3 id=_ltsetpreferences_><em>&lt;setPreferences></em></h3><p><em>void setPreferences(AtClientPreference preference)</em></p><p>The <em>setPreferences</em> method sets the preferences such as sync strategy, storage path etc., for the AtClient instance.</p><h3 id=lt_createclient_>&lt;<em>createClient</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;void> createClient(String currentAtSign, String?

The @platform provides people, entities, and things with unique identifiers called @signs.</p><p>Each @sign creates its own public and private cryptographic key pair. The private keys are kept private and public keys made available globally through the @protocol.</p><p>The @protocol provides verbs for updating and the lookup of fully qualified @signs like location@alice.</p><p>The @protocol supports both a public lookup, in which the querier of the data does not have to prove who they are, and a private lookup, which confirms the @sign of the entity asking for information and allows the owner of the data to decide what information to share. This means that it is possible to receive different answers for the same query if the requesting @signs are different.</p><p>For example, suppose @alice sets the public lookup of location@alice to NYC and the private lookup to her physical address. If anyone looks up location@alice without proving who they are, they will receive the response:</p><p>“NYC”</p><p>However, if @bob, her friend’s @sign, looks up location@alice, then the response will be:</p><p>“Conservatory Water at East 74th Street New York, NY”</p><p>The response to a query is completely under the control of the @sign’s owner, which allows for fine- or coarse-grained customization of responses. The responses also include metadata that specify how long @bob can keep the data, or how often it should be refreshed.</p><p>The @protocol also provides mechanisms for near real-time notifications that are not dependent on the services from the underlying operating system.</p><h1 id=technology-overview>Technology Overview</h1><p>Each participant in the @protocol has a unique identifier known as an @sign. @sign’s are centrally registered and the rest of the infrastructure is fully distributed.</p><p>Every @sign has a unique secondary server microservice that is accessible on the Internet via a unique Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and TCP/IP port number and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.</p><p>The @protocol&rsquo;s objective is to provide end-to-end encrypted data transfer between two known @signs, but also provides access to publicly available data that is cryptographically signed by the creating @sign.</p><p>The @protocol defines a set of verbs that provide proof of the authenticity of the @signs used and allows sharing of access to end-to-end encrypted data. Data ownership is held by the creating @sign and can be updated or rescinded at any time.</p><p>The @protocol uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TLS is used to provide the first layer of authentication, using SSL client certificates as well as in-flight encryption of network traffic.</p><h1 id=the-protocol-design-and-implementation>The @Protocol Design and Implementation</h1><h2 id=functional-goals>Functional Goals</h2><ul><li>Easy to understand</li><li>Intuitive to use</li><li>Privacy by design</li></ul><h2 id=technical-goals>Technical Goals</h2><ul><li>Dependable - Designed for global scale for at least 100 billion people, entities, and things</li><li>Extensible - Protocol is simple enough for developers to build on it</li><li>Near real-time - Data currency ensured</li></ul><h2 id=architectural-guidelines>Architectural guidelines</h2><ul><li>Distribute what you can, centralize what you must</li><li>Always ask for permission</li><li>Data is owned by the individual, persons, entities, or things</li></ul><h1 id=sign-characters>@sign characters</h1><p>The @sign namespace, unlike DNS, extends to Unicode (specifically UTF-8), which allows characters beyond the Latin script.

If needed in the future, this can be opened up further with no changes needed to the protocol, but it will need changes to client databases.</p><p>In the persistence layer, UTF-8 characters in the namespace are translated to UTF-7 and the UTF-7 namespace is used to store data in key/value databases.</p><p>Whilst the wire protocol uses UTF-8, the fully qualified @signs are translated to UTF-7 and need to fit in the namespace below.</p><p>The @sign itself is unique, so it’s also usable as a unique identifier for the application namespace that makes up a composite key. For example, if an application was called @buzz then to ensure the application has no namespace clash, the application owner should own the @buzz @sign. In effect, if you own the @alice you also own alice@ in the namespace for every @sign.</p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 11.png" alt="@protocol namespace" width=65%></td><br><p>While this may look limiting at first glance, the namespace is actually immense.</p><h1 id=conceptual-architecture>Conceptual Architecture</h1><p>Being dependable at scale is the biggest challenge to building new infrastructure at Internet scale. The other part of being dependable are the three security guidelines of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><p>The architecture has to be simple to understand and the codebase must be tightly written. This allows it to be code reviewed and security tested extensively.</p><h2 id=two-tiers>Two Tiers</h2><p>The @protocol has two tiers of servers: the root servers, which provide a global centralized namespace, and the distributed secondary servers, which provide an always-on cache for the data owned by an @sign.</p><p>The root servers are the only centralized part of the @protocol and are centralized to provide a single namespace and a globally dependable platform. No data beyond the @sign and responding authoritative secondary server is held on the root servers. This information is considered public, and no authentication is required to look up the secondary server for a particular @sign.</p><p>Secondary servers provide the second tier of the @protocol architecture, and are responsible for answering lookups for specific @signs. Secondary servers are generally deployed as microservices running on orchestrators such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, but can also run as standalone executables. Secondary servers have to be uniquely Internet addressable through use of an FQDN & Port pair that can be translated via DNS to a unique IP & Port.</p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 12.png" alt="@protocol conceptual architecture" width=65%></td><br><p>It is important to note that devices and clients do not have to be addressable on the Internet, as the secondary server becomes the Internet point of presence for the @sign it serves. This means that devices can be behind firewalls or Network Address Translation (NAT) and still have full @protocol functionality.</p><p>All components of the architecture speak the @protocol and the @protocol itself leverages existing protocols such as TCP/IP, DNS, and TLS. All network traffic is encrypted and authenticated with RSA public/private key pairs that are generated on edge devices.</p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 13.png" alt="@protocol cloud setup" width=65%></td><br><p>All @protocol components are peers within the protocol but only secondary servers can connect and authenticate with each other.</p><p><strong>Public Lookup</strong></p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 14.png" alt="@protocol data flow" width=75%></td><br><p>When a public lookup of an @sign is performed, no authentication is required. Any information can be made public, however, in most cases the information will be private and require the requesting @sign to prove they are who they say they are. This also prevents the root administrators from knowing who is looking up any @sign apart from the IP used to connect and the @sign being queried.</p><p>The proof is the ability to place a cookie at a specified place in the @sign’s name space. For this, the requesting @sign has to authenticate to the secondary server serving the requester’s @sign so the requesting @sign can perform the placement of a challenge. The challenge is to place a specific value in a specific location determined by the serving secondary server. Once the challenge is completed, the resolver will tell the secondary server it’s ready for the lookup of the challenge. If that lookup is successful, then the resolver has successfully proved that they are who they say they are. At that point data lookups can be requested as the requesting, verified @sign.</p><p><strong>Private Lookup</strong></p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 15.png" alt="@protocol namespace" width=75%></td><br><p>Although the diagram looks complicated, the process is a simple series of four verbs that are used in the TCP connections between the secondary servers and the resolver code. The resolver code can live as a single executable (at_cli) onLinux/OSX/Windows, as a library or daemon, or as an app on mobile platforms such as iOS or Android.</p><p>The secondary servers can run virtually anywhere, from a cloud server to dedicated hardware or even running directly on Internet of Things (IoT) devices or mobile phones.</p><p>The only requirement is that the IP address of the FQDN and the port number given by the root server is an <strong>internet routable address and port</strong>. The resolver, in some implementations, can use the secondary server for resolving if it itself does not have full internet access. This enables the resolver to be on a private network but still be able to resolve information. Again, this is similar to the way DNS resolvers can point to another DNS server for resolution.</p><h1 id=root-servers-and-considerations-for-technologists>Root Servers and Considerations for Technologists</h1><p>The @protocol pulls some of its high level architecture from DNS a design that has stood the test of time. As with DNS, the @protocol has root servers that provide redirection to the secondary server for a particular @sign. Unlike DNS there are no <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain>top level domains</a> (TLDs) or subdomains. Data for any @sign is served only by the @sign’s secondary server but to find that server, the root servers must first be queried. This information is considered public.</p><p>The root servers have been designed to scale to billions of @signs and handle the requests for @sign lookups at near real-time, globally. To achieve this, in-memory databases are utilized and only the absolute minimum of data is stored. Just two things can be determined by communicating with the root server: does the @sign exist, and if it does, how to reach it.</p><p>The root servers’ sole role is to centralize the namespace and offer the root service dependably. When asking a root server for the lookup of a particular @sign, the root server will respond with a null if the name does not exist and if the name does exist, the FQDN of the secondary server and the IP port number for that @sign.</p><p>The format is &lt;FQDN>:&lt;PORT>.</p><p>The IP addresses of the root servers are held in DNS at root.atsign.org and the root server itself runs on port 64 (which happens to be ASCII for @). Connecting to the root server provides just an @ prompt and sending a name followed by a CR will return the &lt;FQDN>:&lt;port>. The command to exit is @exit, and any future verbs will start with the @, but at present the only verb for the root server is @exit.</p><h1 id=root-infrastructure>Root Infrastructure</h1><p>The root server is not a single machine, or even a single anything. The root service is run as a set of microservices and backended by in-memory read-only databases across multiple datacenters.</p><h2 id=root-server-verbs>Root Server Verbs</h2><p>The root server only has one verb @exit, all other inputs are considered to be lookup requests.</p><p>(Commands entered are bolded).</p><pre><code>cconstab@cally:~$ openssl s_client -ign_eof -brief root.atsign.org:64

In addition, the @ scheme, &lt;atsign://>, creates a URL (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL>Universal Resource Locator</a>) that can be securely shared and interpreted.

</code></pre><h3 id=ltcram>&lt;cram:></h3><p>To place the cookie to prove ownership and access to the from:@sign, the resolver needs to authenticate to the secondary server. The first method of authenticating is via a shared secret which is, by convention, a 512 bit random string. The same “from” verb is used to create the challenge and the secret is added to the challenge. Then a SHA512 digest is sent with the “cram:” verb to authenticate. The secondary server does the same calculation and, if it matches what was sent, the authentication is agreed and the prompt updated to the @sign of the secondary server. Once authenticated, the “update” verb can be used to place the cookie at the requested place, or any other information placed in the @signs namespace.</p><p>The use of a shared secret is only used as a bootstrap to using the “pkam:” verb, which uses public/private key authentication.</p><p>The “cram:” verb is useful to start up the secondary server with a known secret, and then to share it with the @sign owner via perhaps a QRcode to authenticate.

</code></pre><p>&lt;pkam:></p><p>Whilst shared secrets offer solid security, the secret is shared with both the client and the secondary server, so if you do not trust the administrator of the secondary with a shared secret, you might consider this a security risk. The solution to this issue is the use of a public/private key pair. You create a cryptographic pair of keys, one that you keep for yourself (private) and the other you give to the administrator of the secondary server (public). The challenge from the “from:” verb is given in the same way but instead of using the “cram:” verb to authenticate you use the “pkam:” verb. The “pkam:” verb used to send a cryptographically signed version of the challenge, which can then be validated by the secondary server with the public key.</p><p>This allows only the holder of the private key to authenticate without any shared secrets on the secondary server. In fact, any shared secrets can and should be safely deleted using the “delete:” verb once “pkam:” has been successful.</p><pre><code>cconstab@cally:~/@colin$ openssl s_client -ign_eof -brief 76103630-0f85-5dec-8a91-364bf93b0e8d.hornet.atsign.zone:2499

</code></pre><h2 id=secondary-server-synchronization-verbs>Secondary Server Synchronization Verbs</h2><p>In order to synchronize the data between devices, such as mobile phones, and a secondary server, there are two verbs provided on the server: “stats:” and “sync:”. These two verbs provide enough data to see if the device is behind or ahead of the data stored on the secondary server.</p><p>Each update of data to the secondary server increments a counter (commitId) which is displayed after each update. The devices also keep track of their counters and then can determine if they are ahead or behind the counter on the secondary server.</p><p>If the device is ahead of the secondary server, then the device can use the “update:” verb to update the data. If it is behind the secondary server, then it can use the “sync:” verb to pull the deltas.</p><p>This mechanism allows for multiple devices to sync to the same secondary server. For example, a mobile phone, a tablet, and a PC all synching to a single @sign, but also multiple applications on those devices synching to a single secondary server simultaneously. Each application on each device has a copy of the data and can update and sync it at any time.</p><p>Syncing is the most complex part of the protocol, and it also influences the way data is stored by applications. As all private data is stored in an encrypted format on the secondary server by the @platform SDK, delta updates of data are not possible because the encryption (AES256) ensures that the encrypted data is different even if a single bit changes.</p><pre><code>cconstab@cally:~$ openssl s_client -ign_eof -brief 76103630-0f85-5dec-8a91-364bf93b0e8d.hornet.atsign.zone:2499
