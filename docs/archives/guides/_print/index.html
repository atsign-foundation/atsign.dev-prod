This will provide us with 512 MB of RAM, 1vCPU, 20GB of storage and 1TB of data transfer. This is more then enough to run our dess.</p><p><img src=images/clip_image012.jpg alt=img></p><p>Lastly we have to name our instance.

</code></pre></div><p>Above is the entirety of the update function! The “pair” variable in the first line of the if statement is something that you will see in all @platform applications. The @protocol interprets keys as AtKey objects, which have several attributes like “key”, “metadata”, and “sharedBy” that help the backend understand what to do with them.</p><p>In the code snippet above, we are calling the “key” attribute to add a string that will be paired to a value and the “sharedWith” attribute to define with whom we are sharing this AtKey-value pair. If we’d like to store “hello” and “world” on @bob’s secondary server, we would set pair.key to “hello” and pair.sharedWith to “@bob”. This latter detail may be a bit odd: Bob is sharing this AtKey object with himself so that he can access it! You can see use cases of sharing AtKey-value pairs with other @signs in the <a href=/docs/sample-apps/at_cookbook/>at_cookbook</a> sample app.</p><p>Following up with our “hello” and “world” example, the final step in the _update function is to call the “put” verb from the _serverDemoService object with “pair” as the AtKey instance and “world” as the corresponding value (which should just be a string). When the verb executes successfully, you will have put the “hello” and “world” key-value pair into @bob’s secondary server!</p><p>While this is certainly an impressive feat (after all, these few seemingly unassuming lines of code uniquely encrypts the key-value pair to @bob’s secondary server and makes it persist), we’re still limited by the fact that we can’t retrieve key-value pairs from a secondary server. In the @protocol, retrieving key-value pairs takes two steps: scanning the relevant secondary server for AtKey objects, and getting the value associated with a scanned AtKey object.</p><h3 id=scan>Scan</h3><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve &ldquo;put&rdquo; information on our secondary, we&rsquo;d like to retrieve that key in order to read the information associated with it.

</code></pre></div><p>The only @protocol verb we’re calling in this snippet is “getAtKeys()”. This verb is an incredibly robust function that can gather and sort AtKeys on a secondary server based on things like who shared those AtKeys (the “sharedBy” optional argument) and regular expressions (e.g. the namespace of the application). Because the at_hello_world app is a special case where we only share AtKey objects with ourselves, we can simply call getAtKeys with the “sharedBy” argument set to our own @sign (i.e. widget.atSign). This will return a List of the AtKey objects we want.</p><p>Once you get that List of AtKeys, you’re pretty much finished! In the at_hello_world app, because we want to display keys as strings, we call the “map” method on the List of AtKeys to create a new list that just contains the “key” attribute of each AtKey object. In the last line of code, we call “setState” so that the app loads the newly populated list of keys in the DropdownButton widget.</p><h3 id=lookup>Lookup</h3><p>An individual on the at_hello_world app is given a list of keys, and they select one (_lookupKey) to find its corresponding value.

</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of the if statement, we are creating a new AtKey object called “lookup.” The reason for this is we need a dummy AtKey object that can be passed into the @protocol for looking up the correct value. For the at_hello_world app, this dummy AtKey just needs its “key” and “sharedWith” attributes populated before it can be passed into the “get” verb.</p><p>By the way, if you think creating a copy of an AtKey object is a hassle, that’s totally valid! In a typical @platform application, you have the _scan and _lookup functions merged to some degree so that you can just pass in the AtKey objects we retrieved with the “getAtKeys” verb to the “get” verb. The point of having two separate functions in the at_hello_world project is to define the “scanning” and “getting” steps more concretely.</p><p>“Get” is a very straightforward verb: it gets the value corresponding to a specified AtKey.</p><p>Once we retrieve the value paired with the “lookup” AtKey, all that’s left is calling “setState” to display the “_lookupValue” on screen.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-5a4ca40f98571c6014c33468ab30837a>3.2 - at_chats</h1><div class=lead>Demonstrates the peer to peer chatting capabilities and just how easy it is to implement into any project!</div><p>The at_chat_flutter widget offers a messaging experience that is unique to the @platform. In a traditional messaging application, your texts are stored in a remote database and the person you’re pinging pulls the texts from there (a bit unsettling if you think about it). Of course, there is no such thing as a remote database in the @platform, so we had to be a bit clever coming up with a messaging scheme. In a nutshell, your text messages are not “sent” but rather “shared” with another @sign. All your texts are stored securely in your secondary server and never leave; if you decide to send a message to someone, that person is given permission to view that text via the notify verb. You can see use cases of the notify verb in the <a href=/docs/sample-apps/at_cookbook/>at_cookbook</a> sample app.</p><p>Below, you can see a small demonstration of how the at_chats application works.</p><p align=center><img src=/Sample_Apps/at_chats_demo.gif alt=at_chats height=520px width=300px></p><div style=background-color:#f05f3e;color:#fff;min-height:100px;width:200px;position:relative;float:right;padding:10px;margin-bottom:20px;margin-left:20px><h3>tl;dr</h3>Overview too long for you?

This SDK provides the following capabilities:</p><ul><li>Data is stored in an encrypted keystore locally for your application</li><li>Data access is in-memory and super-fast</li><li>Offline access with the device is supported</li><li>Data is synchronized and backed up to a cloud @server automatically</li><li>Data is synchronized across all the person’s devices automatically</li><li>Privacy is hardcoded: The owner of the data controls all access to it</li></ul><p>Note: the cloud @server does not have access to the secret private key. This prevents bad actors from accessing or modifying private data not meant for them.</p><h5 id=creating-updating-and-deleting-data-with-your-application>Creating, updating and deleting data with your application</h5><p>Data operations that involve writing data to the @persistence keystore can only be done with the approval of the owner. Access to this data is cryptographically controlled. This is managed for your application by the @SDK and is remarkably easy. The types of access that can be set for each data record include:</p><ul><li>public: data that can be read by anyone without need for authentication</li><li>shared: data that the owner has explicitly granted the right to some entity to read it after proving they are who they claim to be</li><li>private: data that is only accessible to the owner (requires authentication)</li><li>hidden: publicly readable data that is not listed in a scan of the keystore.</li></ul><p>Naturally, the owner of an @persistence keystore has access to any and all data that is contained therein. After being authorized, your application can read the data that it needs from the keystore as well. Applications that prefer to rely on data within its own namespace can also store read data from the @persistence keystore with approval of the owner. As always, all data stored is owned and controlled by the owner of the @persistence keystore.</p><p>For more information on how your application can create, update, or delete data, see the <a href=https://pub.dev/packages/at_persistence_spec>@Persistence Keystore Guide</a> and the <a href=https://atsign.dev/docs/functional_architecture/verbs>@Protocol Verbs</a>.</p><h4 id=accessing-data-shared-by-others>Accessing data shared by others</h4><p>Applications typically are a combination of an owner&rsquo;s data and data that has been shared with them by others. This is a new feature and is what we’re referring to when we talk about P2P (Peer-to-Peer) applications.</p><p>For example, messaging applications available today involve a combination of data (messages) from various people but have no way to ensure that each individual message belongs to its creator. With the @protocol, messages that I create and share with other people are owned by me and likewise, messages that others create and share with me are owned by them. The messaging application is thus responsible for interleaving and presenting these messages while simultaneously maintaining privacy controls for the owner of the data (i.e. I own my messages to you and you own your messages to me).</p><p>While this may seem confusing and difficult at first, the @Client SDK and the Flutter UI Component libraries make it very simple to implement. This results in surveillance-free, privacy-compliant applications that are simple, cost-effective, and efficient, with better performance than backend server-based applications of the past.</p><p>The @Client SDK provides the following capabilities that help to integrate data shared by others in your application:</p><ul><li>Public data shared by others can be looked up</li><li>The notification verb alerts your application when new data shared by others is available</li><li>The monitor verb creates a persistent connection for real-time interactions</li><li>Data can be scanned for and read directly from another persons @persistence keystore</li><li>Shared data is cached for fast, reliable access to shared data with all privacy related parameters managed for you by the @Client SDK</li></ul><p>For more information on how your application can create, update, or delete data, see the [@Persistence Keystore Guide](Persistence Keystore Guide) and the <a href=https://atsign.dev/docs/functional_architecture/verbs>@Protocol Verbs</a>.</p><h4 id=accessing-and-reasoning-over-data-stored-by-other-applications>Accessing and reasoning over data stored by other applications</h4><p>One super interesting side effect of giving people control of their data and storing it all in one place is that any application that they authorize can reason over any data that they are allowed to access. Applications that are certified as @protocol compliant (@pps) can provide amazing new experiences because they have the ability to access and reason over all data stored in an @persistence keystore.</p><p>For example, a certified messaging app may contain a thread where a group of people are discussing which movie to go see on Wednesday night. If permitted, this information can also be presented as an event in their certified calendar application and similarly presented as a group in their certified contacts application.</p><h3 id=advanced-options>Advanced Options</h3><h4 id=create-a-separate-persistence-keystore-for-your-application-certification-not-required>Create a separate @persistence keystore for your application (certification not required)</h4><p>If you would like to store application data, you are free to use the @persistence keystore for your persistence if you want to.

The platform is based on the @protocol - a network protocol for the secure exchange of information only between known entities. It uses a unique identifier called an @sign that, combined with the @platform (which is based on the @protocol), allows people the freedom to share, withhold, or retract their information at will with minimal effort, and the developer no longer has to bear the cost and risk of storing and managing people’s personal data.</p><h4 id=protocol->@protocol :</h4><p>The @protocol is the underlying network protocol used by the @platform.The @protocol&rsquo;s objective is to provide end-to-end encrypted data transfer between two known @signs, but also provides access to publicly available data that is cryptographically signed by the creating @sign.</p><h4 id=sign>@sign</h4><p>Each participant in the @protocol has a unique identifier known as an @sign. @sign’s are centrally registered and the rest of the infrastructure is fully distributed.Every @sign has a unique secondary server microservice that is accessible on the Internet via a unique Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and TCP/IP port number and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.</p><h4 id=root-server->root server :</h4><p>The root servers are the only centralized part of the @protocol and are centralized to provide a single namespace and a globally dependable platform. No data beyond the @sign and responding authoritative secondary server is held on the root servers. This information is considered public, and no authentication is required to look up the secondary server for a particular @sign.</p><h4 id=secondary-server->secondary server :</h4><p>Secondary servers provide the second tier of the @protocol architecture, and are responsible for answering lookups for specific @signs. Secondary servers are generally deployed as microservices running on orchestrators such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, but can also run as standalone executables. Secondary servers have to be uniquely Internet addressable through use of an FQDN & Port pair that can be translated via DNS to a unique IP & Port.</p><div class=slideshow-container><div class=intiser><q>I remember seeing The @ Company on a flutter event page for the first time and being immediately captivated by its concept, eventually attending all meetings and workshops despite the time difference.</q></div><div class=intiser style=display:none><q>With the @protocol's unique infrastructure, in-design privacy and off-the-rack backend, a developer has it easy with focusing on other parts of app development and ultimately reduces the overall developemnt time.</q></div><div class=intiser style=display:none><q>After all this time, I think the @platform has come a long way and it will continue to get better and better as time passes.

The rise in popularity of applications with features like end-to-end encryption is but one example. But such solutions are difficult to build, expensive to operate and often insufficient in the degree that they actually deliver privacy.</p><p>The current status quo, in which businesses collect and consolidate consumer data, results in large databases that are tempting targets for hackers. Because of this, new privacy laws such as the <a href=https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/>GDPR</a>, <a href=https://www.acc.com/resource-library/quick-overview-understanding-california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa>CCPA</a>, and 17 US <a href=https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/>state legislations</a> are being implemented. Compliance with these laws is a challenge developers face today that is often treated as an afterthought,and we believe that a better approach is to use a platform that delivers “privacy by design” and assures compliance from the outset.</p><p>Thus we have created a new architecture that addresses these issues at a fundamental level, starting with a new network protocol and a modern development platform implementation that makes it easy for developers to deliver “privacy first” applications.</p><p>If you are thinking about how to deliver applications that are end-to-end encrypted, surveillance-free, and resistant to malicious hacking, read on. The @platform is designed to make it easy to do just that.</p><h2 id=a-simple-definition-of-the-platform>A Simple Definition of the @platform</h2><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 1.png" alt="@platform definition" width=65%></td><p><br>Figure 1. A Simple Definition of the @platform</p><p>The @ Company has created an open platform for developers who want to create applications that give people full control of their digital selves. The platform is based on the @protocol - a network protocol for the secure exchange of information only between known entities. It uses a unique identifier called an @sign that, combined with the @platform (which is based on the @protocol), allows people the freedom to share, withhold, or retract their information at will with minimal effort, and the developer no longer has to bear the cost and risk of storing and managing people’s personal data.</p><h1 id=technology-overview>Technology Overview</h1><p>This document describes a software platform with the necessary technology and tools to help developers create beautiful privacy-first mobile applications that are end-to-end encrypted, surveillance-free, and resistant to malicious hacking.</p><p>It is called the @platform, and is an open source project intended to make it easy for developers to develop and deploy just such applications including the requisite supporting infrastructure at no cost.</p><p>The @platform open source project is embodied in a <a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation>public repository</a> which includes a full stack reference implementation, SDKs for application developers, useful documentation, tools, samples, and examples.</p><p>The reference implementation is licensed under the <a href=https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/>BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” License</a>. At the time of writing, a version written in the <a href=https://dart.dev/>Dart</a> language that supports the Flutter cross-platform framework has been released, with other languages and framework support expected in the future.</p><p>The technology is distributed via the <a href=https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages>Pub package manager</a> as <a href=https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages>libraries</a> for application developers, and via <a href=https://hub.docker.com/u/atsigncompany>dockerhub</a> as containers for developers' infrastructure components.</p><h1 id=from-the-perspective-of-an-application-developer>From the Perspective of an Application Developer</h1><h2 id=the-beautiful-thing-about-a-protocol>The Beautiful Thing About a Protocol</h2><p>There are many important and unique things that arise as a result of an architecture based on a protocol. There is ample precedence for this statement based on other successful examples (SMTP and TCP/IP come to mind). The most important things for an application developer to know about how to use the @platform are:</p><ul><li>Data and processing are pushed to the edge of the internet.</li><li>Applications are based on a peer-to-peer shared data model.</li><li>The sharing of access to private data between application instances is end-to-end encrypted only between provable known parties to prevent surveillance, leakage, or other hijacking attacks.</li></ul><p>These things are the result of the use of the @protocol and can seem very different from the traditional client-server or API means of sharing access to data. Thus, the mental model for such a system, especially from an application developer&rsquo;s perspective, is worthy of discussion up front.</p><h4 id=heading></h4><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 2.png" alt="Data shared on a device" width=70%></td><br>Figure 2: Example of How to Store Shared Data on a Device<p>As shown above, an application developer need only use the platform SDKS to store the application data locally on the device and include an @sign to share it with; the @platform will ensure that the data gets routed to the intended destination in a safe and secure manner. This peer-to-peer model is in contrast to centralized data stores that are fraught with risk of intentional or accidental breach or exposure of private data.</p><h2 id=a-different-way-of-thinking-about-data>A Different Way of Thinking About Data</h2><p>Certainly, there are many benefits to a decentralized data model with strict control on the part of the owner, and the @platform ensures that sharing access to private data is end-to-end encrypted, surveillance free and resistant to malicious hacking. But, there are other benefits of this architecture that may not be so obvious.</p><h3 id=people-own-their-data>People Own Their Data</h3><p>While this is obvious for a “privacy by design” platform, there are additional features that arise from adherence to this principle.</p><ul><li>Data can be portable between similar applications (i.e. swap one Calendar app for another without losing your data), which gives people more choices.</li><li>Application’s data can be shared between disparate applications (e.g. Contacts. Events, Messages) to create altogether new user experiences.</li><li>Applications can reason over “all” their data to produce compelling new services, perhaps aided by ML algorithms (with inferences executed on the mobile device in order to preserve privacy).</li></ul><h3 id=end-to-end-encryption>End-to-End Encryption</h3><p>The @platform ensures that the owner of their data has complete control over it. This is a result of three basic things (though there are many more additional options available that are explained below):</p><ol><li>Encryption happens at the edge.</li><li>The encryption keys are only available at the edge.</li><li>Data sharing is uniquely encrypted between the owner and the intended recipient.</li></ol><h3 id=data-on-the-edge>Data on The Edge</h3><p>A person’s private data is only available “in the clear” on either the owner’s device since only they have the keys to decrypt it or from cached data that can only be decrypted on the device of the recipient it was shared with. This removes the centralized target for hackers and makes any attempt at a large-scale data breach impractical.</p><h3 id=p2p-peer-to-peer-person-to-person>P2P (peer-to-peer, person-to-person)</h3><p>Also important to note is the fact that centralized, shared-tenant resources are no longer required for the sharing of access to private data. This not only saves cost, it also increases performance and security from things like denial of service attacks.</p><h3 id=a-kind-of-polymorphism>A Kind of Polymorphism</h3><p>This means of end-to-end encryption of data has a very interesting side effect in that it produces a kind of polymorphism. Since the shared data is end-to-end encrypted uniquely peer-to-peer between two parties, the answer to a query depends on who is asking, and a different response may be returned for different parties for the same query. For example:</p><table><tr><td><strong>Query</strong></td><td><strong>Who’s asking</strong></td><td><strong>Response</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3>location@alice</td><td>anonymous&lt;public></td><td>California</td></tr><tr><td>@bob</td><td>Bay Area</td></tr><tr><td>@carol</td><td>Home &lt;address></td></tr></table><p>This has already been used to create some very interesting new UX (User Experience) designs and offers many other potential use cases.</p><h4 id=heading-1></h4><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 3.png" alt="Conceptual Model" width=70%></td><br>Figure 3: Data Model Includes Owner Data and Cached Data from Others<br><p>Enforcing data ownership is another important concept as illustrated in Figure 3. In this system, application data becomes a combination of data created by one @sign combined with data that has been shared by others. Since the shared data is encrypted uniquely for the intended recipient, it can only be accessed by them. In addition, the owner maintains control of it (i.e. updates and deletes), though it may be cached for offline use. This means the owner can literally delete their information from another person&rsquo;s phone.</p><h1 id=the-platform-architecture-under-the-covers>The @platform Architecture (Under the Covers)</h1><p>For those who are interested in the nitty-gritty details, this section covers many of the architecture and design details that have been used for the development of this project.</p><h2 id=functional-goals>Functional Goals</h2><ul><li>Provably true privacy and security.</li><li>Support for all popular device architectures with native levels of performance.</li><li>Robust, resilient, and scalable to internet levels.</li></ul><h2 id=technical-goals>Technical Goals</h2><ul><li>Dependable - designed for global scale (~100 billion people, entities, or things).</li><li>Extensible - the platform is simple and extensible.</li><li>Near real time - data currency ensured.</li><li>Online/offline use is supported.</li></ul><h2 id=architectural-guidelines>Architectural Guidelines</h2><ul><li>Modular, componentized design for flexibility and extensibility.</li></ul><h2 id=design-patterns-and-methodologies>Design Patterns And Methodologies</h2><h3 id=separation-of-concerns>Separation of Concerns</h3><p>Great care has been taken when designing this architecture to apply the principles of “Separation of Concerns”.

The SDKs are designed to take care of this complexity for the developer with the goal of making such security ubiquitous.</p><h1 id=the-atclientsdk-at_client_sdkhttpsgithubcomatsign-foundationat_client_sdk>The AtClientSDK (<a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_client_sdk>at_client_sdk</a>)</h1><p>The AtClientSDK encapsulates the @protocol verbs and provides an application level abstraction that is familiar to developers.</p><h2 id=setup-and-configuration-methods>Setup and Configuration Methods</h2><p>The AtClientSDK requires initialization and setup. For convenience, there is a preference object with default settings that is used to configure the instance.</p><h3 id=_ltsetpreferences_><em>&lt;setPreferences></em></h3><p><em>void setPreferences(AtClientPreference preference)</em></p><p>The <em>setPreferences</em> method sets the preferences such as sync strategy, storage path etc., for the AtClient instance.</p><h3 id=lt_createclient_>&lt;<em>createClient</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;void> createClient(String currentAtSign, String?

The @platform provides people, entities, and things with unique identifiers called @signs.</p><p>Each @sign creates its own public and private cryptographic key pair. The private keys are kept private and public keys made available globally through the @protocol.</p><p>The @protocol provides verbs for updating and the lookup of fully qualified @signs like location@alice.</p><p>The @protocol supports both a public lookup, in which the querier of the data does not have to prove who they are, and a private lookup, which confirms the @sign of the entity asking for information and allows the owner of the data to decide what information to share. This means that it is possible to receive different answers for the same query if the requesting @signs are different.</p><p>For example, suppose @alice sets the public lookup of location@alice to NYC and the private lookup to her physical address. If anyone looks up location@alice without proving who they are, they will receive the response:</p><p>“NYC”</p><p>However, if @bob, her friend’s @sign, looks up location@alice, then the response will be:</p><p>“Conservatory Water at East 74th Street New York, NY”</p><p>The response to a query is completely under the control of the @sign’s owner, which allows for fine- or coarse-grained customization of responses. The responses also include metadata that specify how long @bob can keep the data, or how often it should be refreshed.</p><p>The @protocol also provides mechanisms for near real-time notifications that are not dependent on the services from the underlying operating system.</p><h1 id=technology-overview>Technology Overview</h1><p>Each participant in the @protocol has a unique identifier known as an @sign. @sign’s are centrally registered and the rest of the infrastructure is fully distributed.</p><p>Every @sign has a unique secondary server microservice that is accessible on the Internet via a unique Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and TCP/IP port number and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.</p><p>The @protocol&rsquo;s objective is to provide end-to-end encrypted data transfer between two known @signs, but also provides access to publicly available data that is cryptographically signed by the creating @sign.</p><p>The @protocol defines a set of verbs that provide proof of the authenticity of the @signs used and allows sharing of access to end-to-end encrypted data. Data ownership is held by the creating @sign and can be updated or rescinded at any time.</p><p>The @protocol uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TLS is used to provide the first layer of authentication, using SSL client certificates as well as in-flight encryption of network traffic.</p><h1 id=the-protocol-design-and-implementation>The @Protocol Design and Implementation</h1><h2 id=functional-goals>Functional Goals</h2><ul><li>Easy to understand</li><li>Intuitive to use</li><li>Privacy by design</li></ul><h2 id=technical-goals>Technical Goals</h2><ul><li>Dependable - Designed for global scale for at least 100 billion people, entities, and things</li><li>Extensible - Protocol is simple enough for developers to build on it</li><li>Near real-time - Data currency ensured</li></ul><h2 id=architectural-guidelines>Architectural guidelines</h2><ul><li>Distribute what you can, centralize what you must</li><li>Always ask for permission</li><li>Data is owned by the individual, persons, entities, or things</li></ul><h1 id=sign-characters>@sign characters</h1><p>The @sign namespace, unlike DNS, extends to Unicode (specifically UTF-8), which allows characters beyond the Latin script.

If needed in the future, this can be opened up further with no changes needed to the protocol, but it will need changes to client databases.</p><p>In the persistence layer, UTF-8 characters in the namespace are translated to UTF-7 and the UTF-7 namespace is used to store data in key/value databases.</p><p>Whilst the wire protocol uses UTF-8, the fully qualified @signs are translated to UTF-7 and need to fit in the namespace below.</p><p>The @sign itself is unique, so it’s also usable as a unique identifier for the application namespace that makes up a composite key. For example, if an application was called @buzz then to ensure the application has no namespace clash, the application owner should own the @buzz @sign. In effect, if you own the @alice you also own alice@ in the namespace for every @sign.</p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 11.png" alt="@protocol namespace" width=65%></td><br><p>While this may look limiting at first glance, the namespace is actually immense.</p><h1 id=conceptual-architecture>Conceptual Architecture</h1><p>Being dependable at scale is the biggest challenge to building new infrastructure at Internet scale. The other part of being dependable are the three security guidelines of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><p>The architecture has to be simple to understand and the codebase must be tightly written. This allows it to be code reviewed and security tested extensively.</p><h2 id=two-tiers>Two Tiers</h2><p>The @protocol has two tiers of servers: the root servers, which provide a global centralized namespace, and the distributed secondary servers, which provide an always-on cache for the data owned by an @sign.</p><p>The root servers are the only centralized part of the @protocol and are centralized to provide a single namespace and a globally dependable platform. No data beyond the @sign and responding authoritative secondary server is held on the root servers. This information is considered public, and no authentication is required to look up the secondary server for a particular @sign.</p><p>Secondary servers provide the second tier of the @protocol architecture, and are responsible for answering lookups for specific @signs. Secondary servers are generally deployed as microservices running on orchestrators such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, but can also run as standalone executables. Secondary servers have to be uniquely Internet addressable through use of an FQDN & Port pair that can be translated via DNS to a unique IP & Port.</p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 12.png" alt="@protocol conceptual architecture" width=65%></td><br><p>It is important to note that devices and clients do not have to be addressable on the Internet, as the secondary server becomes the Internet point of presence for the @sign it serves. This means that devices can be behind firewalls or Network Address Translation (NAT) and still have full @protocol functionality.</p><p>All components of the architecture speak the @protocol and the @protocol itself leverages existing protocols such as TCP/IP, DNS, and TLS. All network traffic is encrypted and authenticated with RSA public/private key pairs that are generated on edge devices.</p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 13.png" alt="@protocol cloud setup" width=65%></td><br><p>All @protocol components are peers within the protocol but only secondary servers can connect and authenticate with each other.</p><p><strong>Public Lookup</strong></p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 14.png" alt="@protocol data flow" width=75%></td><br><p>When a public lookup of an @sign is performed, no authentication is required. Any information can be made public, however, in most cases the information will be private and require the requesting @sign to prove they are who they say they are. This also prevents the root administrators from knowing who is looking up any @sign apart from the IP used to connect and the @sign being queried.</p><p>The proof is the ability to place a cookie at a specified place in the @sign’s name space. For this, the requesting @sign has to authenticate to the secondary server serving the requester’s @sign so the requesting @sign can perform the placement of a challenge. The challenge is to place a specific value in a specific location determined by the serving secondary server. Once the challenge is completed, the resolver will tell the secondary server it’s ready for the lookup of the challenge. If that lookup is successful, then the resolver has successfully proved that they are who they say they are. At that point data lookups can be requested as the requesting, verified @sign.</p><p><strong>Private Lookup</strong></p><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 15.png" alt="@protocol namespace" width=75%></td><br><p>Although the diagram looks complicated, the process is a simple series of four verbs that are used in the TCP connections between the secondary servers and the resolver code. The resolver code can live as a single executable (at_cli) onLinux/OSX/Windows, as a library or daemon, or as an app on mobile platforms such as iOS or Android.</p><p>The secondary servers can run virtually anywhere, from a cloud server to dedicated hardware or even running directly on Internet of Things (IoT) devices or mobile phones.</p><p>The only requirement is that the IP address of the FQDN and the port number given by the root server is an <strong>internet routable address and port</strong>. The resolver, in some implementations, can use the secondary server for resolving if it itself does not have full internet access. This enables the resolver to be on a private network but still be able to resolve information. Again, this is similar to the way DNS resolvers can point to another DNS server for resolution.</p><h1 id=root-servers-and-considerations-for-technologists>Root Servers and Considerations for Technologists</h1><p>The @protocol pulls some of its high level architecture from DNS a design that has stood the test of time. As with DNS, the @protocol has root servers that provide redirection to the secondary server for a particular @sign. Unlike DNS there are no <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain>top level domains</a> (TLDs) or subdomains. Data for any @sign is served only by the @sign’s secondary server but to find that server, the root servers must first be queried. This information is considered public.</p><p>The root servers have been designed to scale to billions of @signs and handle the requests for @sign lookups at near real-time, globally. To achieve this, in-memory databases are utilized and only the absolute minimum of data is stored. Just two things can be determined by communicating with the root server: does the @sign exist, and if it does, how to reach it.</p><p>The root servers’ sole role is to centralize the namespace and offer the root service dependably. When asking a root server for the lookup of a particular @sign, the root server will respond with a null if the name does not exist and if the name does exist, the FQDN of the secondary server and the IP port number for that @sign.</p><p>The format is &lt;FQDN>:&lt;PORT>.</p><p>The IP addresses of the root servers are held in DNS at root.atsign.org and the root server itself runs on port 64 (which happens to be ASCII for @). Connecting to the root server provides just an @ prompt and sending a name followed by a CR will return the &lt;FQDN>:&lt;port>. The command to exit is @exit, and any future verbs will start with the @, but at present the only verb for the root server is @exit.</p><h1 id=root-infrastructure>Root Infrastructure</h1><p>The root server is not a single machine, or even a single anything. The root service is run as a set of microservices and backended by in-memory read-only databases across multiple datacenters.</p><h2 id=root-server-verbs>Root Server Verbs</h2><p>The root server only has one verb @exit, all other inputs are considered to be lookup requests.</p><p>(Commands entered are bolded).</p><pre><code>cconstab@cally:~$ openssl s_client -ign_eof -brief root.atsign.org:64

</code></pre><p>In this case the secondary server is asking for the challenge “038d5c0e-34de-4227-9a86-da6cefe83f73” to be placed at the location “_4828b6c6-17cd-4d2e-91a3-d9eab3ebd591@colin” with the header of “data:proof:”. The challenge being that, to actually place that cookie on the @colin, secondary server requires access to the @colin secondary server which is only achievable for the person who has the @colin keys. Once in place, the challenge response needs to be public and cryptographically signed by the @colin secondary server.</p><p>Public access is important as the @realisticforeign secondary server will want to lookup that challenge to prove the request is actually from @colin. The type of challenge and the location is in the format of a UUID v4, ensuring that the likelihood of a namespace clash is mathematically unlikely, especially when coupled with the timeout of any challenges placed within a few minutes or the fact that they are cleared once used.</p><p>It is also worth noting that locations that are prepended with _ do not show up when using the scan verb, which is explained later.</p><h3 id=ltpol>&lt;pol></h3><p>Once the cookie is placed, the proof of life (pol) verb is used to signal to the @realisticforeign secondary server to check for the cookie on the @colin secondary server. The secondary server responds to the “pol” verb by looking up the location of the “from:” @sign using the root servers, then connecting to the secondary server for that @sign and using the “lookup” verb to look for the cookie at the challenge location. If the cookie is found then the prompt is changed to the @sign in the from:@sign, confirming that the “pol” verb was successful. If the cookie was not found for any reason, the @ prompt is returned.</p><pre><code>cconstab@cally:~/@colin$ openssl s_client -ign_eof -brief -cert ./cert.pem -key ./privkey.pem -CAfile ./fullchain.pem   ba46657d-227b-5ecf-ad16-161f80249772.hornet.atsign.zone:2489

The first method of authenticating is via a shared secret which is, by convention, a 512 bit random string. The same “from” verb is used to create the challenge and the secret is added to the challenge. Then a SHA512 digest is sent with the “cram:” verb to authenticate. The secondary server does the same calculation and, if it matches what was sent, the authentication is agreed and the prompt updated to the @sign of the secondary server.

</code></pre><p>&lt;pkam:></p><p>Whilst shared secrets offer solid security, the secret is shared with both the client and the secondary server, so if you do not trust the administrator of the secondary with a shared secret, you might consider this a security risk. The solution to this issue is the use of a public/private key pair. You create a cryptographic pair of keys, one that you keep for yourself (private) and the other you give to the administrator of the secondary server (public). The challenge from the “from:” verb is given in the same way but instead of using the “cram:” verb to authenticate you use the “pkam:” verb. The “pkam:” verb used to send a cryptographically signed version of the challenge, which can then be validated by the secondary server with the public key.</p><p>This allows only the holder of the private key to authenticate without any shared secrets on the secondary server.

</code></pre><h2 id=secondary-server-synchronization-verbs>Secondary Server Synchronization Verbs</h2><p>In order to synchronize the data between devices, such as mobile phones, and a secondary server, there are two verbs provided on the server: “stats:” and “sync:”. These two verbs provide enough data to see if the device is behind or ahead of the data stored on the secondary server.</p><p>Each update of data to the secondary server increments a counter (commitId) which is displayed after each update. The devices also keep track of their counters and then can determine if they are ahead or behind the counter on the secondary server.</p><p>If the device is ahead of the secondary server, then the device can use the “update:” verb to update the data. If it is behind the secondary server, then it can use the “sync:” verb to pull the deltas.</p><p>This mechanism allows for multiple devices to sync to the same secondary server. For example, a mobile phone, a tablet, and a PC all synching to a single @sign, but also multiple applications on those devices synching to a single secondary server simultaneously. Each application on each device has a copy of the data and can update and sync it at any time.</p><p>Syncing is the most complex part of the protocol, and it also influences the way data is stored by applications. As all private data is stored in an encrypted format on the secondary server by the @platform SDK, delta updates of data are not possible because the encryption (AES256) ensures that the encrypted data is different even if a single bit changes.</p><pre><code>cconstab@cally:~$ openssl s_client -ign_eof -brief 76103630-0f85-5dec-8a91-364bf93b0e8d.hornet.atsign.zone:2499

What does forking a repository mean? What is a pull request? How can you make a contribution?</p><h2 id=what-is-an-open-source-project>What is an open source project?</h2><p>For anyone who is new to not just software development but project management in general, an open source project is that of which any person has access to all of the details of the project and are free to utilize it, use it for research purposes, make modifications to it, and even distribute it elsewhere. GitHub of course, being one of the main wellsprings of open source projects! For the sake of this article, I will be using <a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation>The @ Company’s atsign-foundation</a> repository to explain any examples.</p><h2 id=why-would-you-want-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project>Why would you want to contribute to an open source project?</h2><p>With the new, blossoming field of data science, being capable of finding your way around a GitHub project is a significantly useful skill in today’s world. You’ll find that many corporate entities will highlight your contributions to any GitHub project (as long as you have listed them within your résumé!). You’ll also find that there are many friendly developers who really appreciate the people who add modifications to the project, and especially if that modification comes with a flagged issue (there seems to be a special place in the heart of a developer for people who raise issues within their code)! There’s also this sense of great accomplishment when you can add something useful to a project, more importantly, for the projects that you use often.</p><h2 id=how-can-you-contribute-to-an-open-source-project>How can you contribute to an open source project?</h2><h3 id=choosing-a-project>Choosing a Project:</h3><p>The first step in contributing something to a project is knowing what project you will contribute to! I’d personally recommend thinking about a project or an idea you have familiarity with as this will greatly assist in understanding what the project’s purpose is.</p><h2 id=forking-a-repository>Forking a Repository:</h2><p>What is forking? In simplest terms, forking a project is simply making a copy of it to your own GitHub profile. GitHub allows anyone to fork a repository and this will allow you to do whatever you please with the entire repository without making any actual changes to the real project! Imagine it as taking a picture of a tree. You can make edits to your photo to make the tree look purple or to give it a face, but you won’t make any changes to the actual tree!</p><h3 id=how-to-fork-a-repository>How to Fork a Repository:</h3><p>First, navigate to the home page of the repository you wish to fork. Refer to the screenshot below:</p><p>Here, you can see that I am currently within the atsign-foundation’s ‘<a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_demos>at_demos</a>’ repository.</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/fork-button.png alt=fork-button title="Fork button"></p><p>If you look at the top right corner of the repository’s page, you’ll notice the ‘Fork’ button and a number next to it. That number represents the number of times this specific repository has been forked. Once you select the Fork button, GitHub will prompt you which repository you wish to fork to. My go-to option is typically my own profile, where it will create an entire repository under your profile name so that you may make whatever modifications you wish. After you choose what location you wish to fork to, GitHub will do all of the hard work for you. After a few seconds or so (depending on your Internet connection speed), you’ll find that the entire repository that you forked, is now copied to wherever you told GitHub to fork it! Congratulations! You’ve forked a repository!</p><h3 id=make-modifications-to-the-repository>Make Modifications to the Repository:</h3><p>Now, you can do whatever your heart so desires with the project! Depending on what the project is, you may wish to clone the repository to your local machine using https/, or simply commit changes directly on your forked repository (totally your choice/preference!).</p><h3 id=creating-a-public-key-with-github>Creating a Public Key with GitHub</h3><p>We recommend git cloning the repository using the SSH key option. You can set up your own public keys on GitHub quite easily. If you see below, you will see the Clone options, &lsquo;HTTPS, SSH, and GitHub CLI&rsquo;. Select the &lsquo;SSH&rsquo; option and this will provide you a password-protected SSH key to git clone the repository.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/GitHub-Code-Options.png alt=GitHub-Code-Options title="download theme options"></p><p>In order to create a public key on your machine, open any UNIX terminal and type the command:</p><pre><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre><p>From here, it will ask you to choose a lcoation to store the key. We suggest just clicking &lsquo;enter&rsquo; on whatever location is chosen for you. It will then ask for a passphrase, we STRONGLY recommend clicking &lsquo;enter&rsquo; again to not input a passphrase. After doing this, it will ask you to input the passphrase again and click &lsquo;enter&rsquo; without inputting anything. After having successully creating the key, enter the command:</p><pre><code>cat ~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
</code></pre><p>This will print out your public key. Copy the entire thing, including the ssh in the beginning and whatever the final character is and navigate to your GitHub settings page. Within your settings, you will see a tab titled, &lsquo;SSH and GPG keys&rsquo;. Once you navigate to this page, you should see a green bottom near the top-left titled, &lsquo;New SSH key&rsquo;. Once you have clciked this and navigated to the new SSH Key page, you will have to input a name for the key as well as pasting the retrieved key copied from the above command. After you have done both of these things, you can finish with the &lsquo;Add SSH key&rsquo; button and you will now be able to git clone in your terminal with the SSH URL.</p><h3 id=create-a-pull-request>Create a Pull Request:</h3><p>After you are satisfied with the changes you have made to the project and are confident that this change will be beneficial to include, all you now have to do is create a pull request within the project’s real repository. GitHub has made it very simple to create a pull request for comparing forks. Refer to the screenshot below:</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/pull-request.png alt=pull-request title="Pull request option"></p><p>You may notice, in the top left corner of the repository, you will see the ‘Pull requests’ option. After selecting this, you will be taken to the Pull Requests page. This page will show you every pull request that has been created for the specific repository. If you see below, there has been one pull request for this repository thus far.</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/page-pull-request.png alt=pull-request-page title="Pull request page"></p><p>If you are sure you are ready to create a new pull request, simply click the ‘New pull request’ button. This will then navigate you to the compare page. If you followed the above steps, you would want to ‘compare forks’, which will be a small hyperlink as circled below:</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/compare-changes.png alt=compare-changes title="Compare changes"></p><p>This will now change the base and head repositories that will be compared. Be sure to select the correct branch of the real project that you wish to make a pull request for. Select the same repository you forked and the correct branch as the ‘base’ repository and ‘base’ branch. You may need to contact the project leader or one of the main developers if you need assistance for which branch you need to make a pull request for. After selecting these, be very careful in selecting the repository that you forked. This will be where you had made the modifications. Select this repository as the ‘head’ repository and ‘compare’ branch.</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/review-mods.png alt=review-mods title="Review modifications"></p><p>From here, you will see all of the modifications that will occur if your pull request is accepted. Once you double check all of these modifications and are confident in it, you may now select ‘Create pull request’. You may notice that mine says ‘View pull request’ but that is because I have already gone through this process and have successfully created one.</p><p>Side note:
Be sure that your contribution will be useful for those who utilize the project! If you do end up creating a pull request with your modifications, make sure that those modifications are properly documented in both the code and/or the comment section of the pull request itself.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-49e4114c7fadc5f1df6bfed7b8a9e89b>8 -</h1><h1 id=working-with-hugo-static-webpage-generator>Working With Hugo (Static Webpage Generator)</h1><h2 id=overview>Overview:</h2><p>Hugo, an open-source static website generator, is a new way to create web pages easily with flexible thematic capabilities. How do you get started with it and how can you go from beginner to confident?</p><h2 id=what-is-hugo>What is Hugo?</h2><p>Hugo is a static site generator that can be seen as a competitor for WordPress and Bootstrap. The best part about Hugo that differentiates it from its competitors is that it is an open-source project, which means it’s free to use! Hugo also makes content management a headache-free, comprehensive process! Hugo can be incredible for this type of content management due to not even needing to write HTML if web development is not something you’re comfortable with! If you are the type who really enjoys getting your hands dirty, Hugo’s flexibility expands to allowing developers to completely modify everything about their own static web page. Now what’s a static web page? You can pretty much sum it up to be a hard-coded page of information that, of course, does not change dynamically. The best advantage that static web pages have over dynamic web pages is the extreme difference in speed. Because most dynamic websites are producing content for the individual visitor, it can take much longer to produce the content.</p><p>There’s a growing community behind Hugo with numerous Stack Overflow locations with any questions relevant to that of Hugo.
Getting Started with Hugo:</p><h2 id=windows>Windows:</h2><h3 id=installing-hugo-on-windows>Installing Hugo on Windows:</h3><p>There are a few ways in which you can get started with Hugo, however the easiest way I have found to getting started and jumping straight into things is by the following steps:</p><p>Create a directory in a location on your drive. For me, I have more storage capacity within my D: drive so I navigate to my D: drive within my File Explorer and simply right click and select ‘Folder’. This will create a new folder wherever you were within your drive. Next, rename this folder to ‘Hugo’. After this, navigate inside of your Hugo folder and create another folder within it, this time calling it ‘bin’.</p><p>You’re now ready to download Hugo on to your machine. As most projects which are open-source can be found on GitHub, so can Hugo’s releases. In any web browser, navigate to the <a href=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases title="GoHugo Resources">GoHugoIo</a> repository. Here, you will find a great list of all of the releases catered for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Be sure to select a release that has your operating system in the title. For example, I am using a Windows 10 machine that runs a 64 bit processor. So I navigated to the zip file titled hugo_extended_0.83.1_Windows-64bit.zip. (Note: the release number may be different from the one listed above due to the time at which I have written this document. You may also noticed that I have chosen the extended Hugo version. Hugo extended has more capabilities, especially for thematic purposes. Hugo&rsquo;s extension comes with a few advantages such as; SASS/SCSS support, Minify javascript and css, resource catenation, source mapping, image processing and so much more. A more in depth view of it can be found <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-extended>here</a>.</p><p>Once you have found the matching release title for your machine, feel free to simply download the zip file. Where you download the zip file does not matter, however, where you extract it does. When your download is complete, select ‘Extract all’ and be sure that you extract the contents of what you downloaded into the ‘bin’ folder that exists within your Hugo folder. Once the extraction is complete, it should look something like this:</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_file_location.PNG alt=bin-folder title="bin folder"></p><p>For the release that I have downloaded and extracted, there are three files. Perhaps in a later release of Hugo, there may be more files included, but for now, as long as you have the application file titled ‘hugo’, you will be fine. If, for whatever odd reason, the ‘hugo’ file is titled something else, be sure to rename it to ‘hugo’ (note the lowercase ‘h’). There is also a license file and a readme. It is completely up to you if you read the readme and license files.</p><p>Determining if your Installation on Windows was successful:</p><p>Apologies in advance for MacOS and Linux users as I will be demonstrating the following steps using a Windows 10 machine. A later edit with both MacOS and Linux will be created to cater those who wish to learn from a separate operating system.
To make sure that your Hugo was successfully installed and extracted, open your command prompt [Some ways in which this can be done => (Win key + r, type ‘cmd’, hit ‘enter’), (Go to your Search bar and the bottom of your taskbar and type in ‘cmd’ or ‘command prompt’ and hit ‘enter’)] and navigate to the directory where you extracted Hugo. For the above picture, my hugo.exe file’s location was D:\Hugo\bin\hugo.exe, so all I have to type is ‘cd D:\Hugo\bin’ and I will be taken to where the hugo.exe exists. If you’re not sure where you had saved your Hugo folder, you can either use the File Explorer you have presently open and simply highlight the path that is in the bar above your currently open Hugo folder. I have circled it below for your convenience.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_file_location_circled.PNG alt=file-location title="file location"></p><p>To show what your command prompt should look like:
<img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_location.PNG alt=hugo-location title="cmd location"></p><p>Once you are here, feel free to try the command ‘hugo version’:
<img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_bin_version.PNG alt=hugo-version title="hugo version"></p><p>If your command prompt happily prints out the current version of Hugo you have on your machine, this means you have successfully installed and extracted Hugo onto your machine. However, you may notice that if you use the command ‘cd ..’ to move directories to the ‘Hugo’ folder rather than ‘bin’ and try the command ‘hugo version’ you will be hit with an error or Windows will tell you that hugo isn’t a recognized command.
<img src=images/getting-started/hugo-not-recognized.png alt=hugo-error title="hugo error"></p><p>If you are like me, and wish to be capable of using the hugo command anywhere on your machine, maybe because you would like to create a web page with its own folder and its own content, there is an easy way to fix this.</p><p>What you will have to do is navigate to your ‘Search’ bar and type in ‘env’ or ‘environment’. Windows will suggest the ‘Edit the System Environment Variables’. Open it and a System Properties dialog box should appear and look something like this:
<img src=images/getting-started/env-variables.png alt=env-variables title="system properties"></p><p>Double-click on the button labeled ‘Environment Variables’ and this will open the dialog box where you can edit the environment variables of your machine. You may be wondering what environment variables are and what they’re for. In simplest terms, just like how you noticed that your hugo command did not work outside of the bin folder, there are other applications that work the same way and will only work in the folder they exist in. Windows has the capability of allowing you to run the application from anywhere, which is exactly what we would like to do. You should see something in your ‘user variables’ called Path. Each Path that is listed, is more than likely an application, similar to your Hugo, that exists only in a folder but is used globally on your machine. Highlight ‘Path’ and click ‘Edit&mldr;’. This will open a new dialog box that will list the individual paths that already exist. Click ‘New’ and simply type (or paste) the location of your hugo.exe. If you may recall from my example, my hugo.exe was in the following location; D:\hugo_ext\bin.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Hugo-Path-Edit.png alt=hugo-path-edit title="environment variables"></p><p>Here’s what mine looks like after I have finished typing in where it exists (it is the one highlighted in blue). After you have done the same, you can now click ‘OK’ until all of the dialog boxes are closed. Now this is where the magic happens! After restarting your computer, try using the ‘hugo version’ command again outside of the ‘Hugo\bin’ folder and see if Windows recognizes it as a command! I simply started up my command prompt and immediately typed in ‘hugo version’ and it worked. If the command works, you are now ready to get started on a Hugo project.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/hugo-version-extended.PNG alt=Hugo-Version-Outside-Bin title="hugo version outside bin"></p><h2 id=mac>Mac:</h2><h3 id=installing-hugo-on-mac>Installing Hugo on Mac:</h3><p>The first step you will want to take is navigating to the website <a href=https://brew.sh title="Homebrew Installation">Homebrew</a>. This website is a package manager and allows you to install, download and manage packages. You can use <a href=https://brew.sh title="Homebrew Installation">Homebrew</a> to install Hugo easily on your computer. Once you are taken to the landing page, you should come across a terminal command that looks like:</p><pre><code>/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
</code></pre><p>// NOTE:
// This command may be updated depending on any new releases,
// so be sure to check the website before copying the line of code above!</p><p>Simply paste the line of code into your terminal. Once you click enter and input your password for administrative access, Homebrew will begin installing itself onto your machine. This can take a few minutes. Once Homebrew is finished, you can then type the command:</p><pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre><p>Homebrew may update itself automatically before installing hugo.</p><h3 id=determining-if-your-installation-on-windows-was-successful>Determining if your Installation on Windows was successful:</h3><p>You can validate your install by the command:</p><pre><code>which hugo
</code></pre><p>You can also use the command:</p><pre><code>hugo version
</code></pre><p>If you run into an error, proceed through the Windows steps and follow the instructions up until the GitHub section where you manually install the package from the repository for your own machine.</p><h2 id=creating-a-hugo-project>Creating a Hugo project:</h2><p>Depending on your operating system, open your command prompt/terminal. You can also launch an IDE of your preference and have the terminal open within it. To create a new hugo project, be sure that you are within a directory that you would want to have your Hugo project created in. For this article, I will create a new folder within my D: drive (Windows) and then use the command:</p><pre><code>hugo new site your_name_here
</code></pre><p>Refer to the steps within my command prompt below: I first check that my hugo command works, change directory into my D: drive, create a new folder called, ‘my_hugo_site’, navigate into that folder, and then create a new Hugo site called, ‘my_hugo_project’.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Hugo-New-Site.png alt=Hugo-New-Site title="hugo version outside bin"></p><p>If you receive the ‘Congratulations!’ message, this means that you have successfully created a new Hugo site. If you expand the project folder to see its contents, you will see that a few folders have been created. (Be sure that you navigate within your newly created project first!)</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Hugo-Project-Folders.png alt=Hugo-Project-Folders title="hugo version outside bin"></p><p>The number of folders created here may seem a bit overwhelming, but have no fear! We will go over what each folder is for.</p><h3 id=archetypes>Archetypes:</h3><p>The first folder is the ‘archetypes’ folder. This folder is typically used by those more confident with Hugo. An archetype, in its simplest form, is simply a constant that occurs throughout all of the content of your website, something that will not change. With Hugo, you can manually create data about your site (for you Computer Scientists, that’s metadata!). What this means is that you can assign values to things that will not be changing. This could mean, who initially created the website, what date it was created, what information populates the site itself, and etc.</p><h3 id=content>Content:</h3><p>A very self explanatory folder, this is where the main content of your site will exist.</p><h3 id=data>Data:</h3><p>You can almost view this as your website’s own database which can house .json files and allows you to utilize information that exists within external pieces.</p><h3 id=layouts>Layouts:</h3><p>Just like a word document, if you wish to add information within the same location of every page that exists on your website, such as a header or a footer, this is where you would add that.</p><h3 id=static>Static:</h3><p>This is, of course, where your static elements will exist. These elements may include your javascript or css files.</p><h3 id=configtoml>config.toml:</h3><p>This file contains the settings of your website, such as its URL, what language it contains, and the title of the website.</p><h3 id=themes>Themes:</h3><p>If graphic design isn’t one of your strengths, Hugo being an open-source project means that there are countless persons releasing their own themes and layouts for you to use! You can browse these themes <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io title="Hugo Themes">here</a>. Installing a theme is just as simple as downloading a folder to your machine, because that is exactly what you are doing! You may notice that every theme which peaks your interest will also exist on GitHub. You can use whatever method you prefer to retrieve the code. In this document, I will demonstrate a couple ways to do this. Once you find a theme that suits your needs or ‘aesthetic’, simply click on the theme. You may see two or three buttons, ‘Download’, ‘Demo’, ‘Homepage’. If you are confident that this is the theme you want, click ‘Download’ and it will take you to the GitHub repository where the theme exists. Click on the green ‘Code’ button and this will give you a few options on how to retrieve the code.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/GitHub-Code-Options.png alt=Git-Clone-Theme title="download theme options"></p><p>For this example, I have found a theme that interests me titled ‘Dream’. For users who have Git, you can copy the https link and navigate into the ‘themes’ folder of your project to git clone it. Refer to the screenshot below (I am using Git Bash):</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Git-Clone-Theme.png alt=Git-Clone-Theme title="git bash theme clone"></p><p>When you clone the repository, it will automatically create a folder for you. However, if you are not sure how to use Git, you can simply download the Zip file onto your machine. Before installing this zip folder, be sure to create a folder within your ‘themes’ folder with the appropriate title of the theme you are downloading. After downloading the zip folder, you should extract the contents into the folder that you just created inside of your ‘themes’ folder. You can see in the screenshot below, that the folder ‘hugo-theme-dream’ exists within the ‘themes’ folder.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Theme-File-Location.png alt=Theme-File-Location title="themes folder"></p><p>After successfully implementing the above steps, navigate into your config.toml file and add the line of code below everything else that exists in the file:</p><pre><code>theme = “folder_name_here”
</code></pre><p>So, in my case, I would type the following:</p><pre><code>theme = “hugo-theme-dream”
</code></pre><p>After adding this line, save the document and to make sure that you have properly called this theme into your site use the following command in your command prompt/terminal to start up your Hugo local server:</p><pre><code>hugo server -D
</code></pre><p>The -D will launch all of the draft pages that exist within your project folder.</p><p>After this, you can now open any web browser and type in the URL:</p><p><a href=http://localhost:1313>localhost:1313</a></p><p>You should now see your website and the theme you installed!
